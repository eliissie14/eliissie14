- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eliissie14
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in remembering what I learned a long time ago.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have completed a computer A-driving license exam, a computer AB-driving license exam, and a Bachelor of Science in Business Manager. I have used operating systems Windows (from 1.0 to 10), Linux (Debian and Ubuntu), Mac OS (7 and X) and MS-DOS. I started using computers on a Commodore 64 with Giana Sisters (of course) and Amiga, as well as a Macintosh. The Nintendo NES is a familiar gaming console with Super Mario Bros and Duck Hunt.
