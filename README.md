- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eliissie14
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in remembering what I learned a long time ago.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have completed a computer A-driving license exam, a computer AB-driving license exam, and a Bachelor of Science in Business Manager. I have used operating systems Windows (1.0, 3.1, 3.11, 95, NT Workstation 4.0, NT 5.0, 2000 Professional, Millennium Edition, XP Professional, Vista, 8.1 and 10), Linux (Debian and Ubuntu), Mac OS (Apple Lisa, 7, 9 and X) and MS-DOS. I started using computers on a Commodore 64 with Giana Sisters and Amiga, as well as a Macintosh. The Nintendo NES is a familiar gaming console with Super Mario Bros and Duck Hunt.
